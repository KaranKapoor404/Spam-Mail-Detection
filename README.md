---

## 🧠 Project overview

spam emails are unwanted, often harmful messages sent in bulk. detecting them automatically helps protect users from phishing, scams, and unnecessary clutter.

in this project, we:
- preprocess raw email text ✂️
- convert text into numerical features 🔢
- train a machine learning model 🤖
- predict whether an email is spam or ham 📬

## 🚀 Features

- text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.)
- feature extraction using **bag of words / tf-idf**
- machine learning model training
- accuracy and performance evaluation
- easy to understand jupyter notebook format
